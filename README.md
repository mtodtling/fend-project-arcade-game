## What the Game Looks Like

## How the Game Works
The goal of the game is to get the player to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies (bugs).

- The player can move left, right, up and down using keyboard arrow keys
- The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
- Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
- Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won
